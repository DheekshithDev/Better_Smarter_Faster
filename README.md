# Better_Smarter_Faster
This project is a continuation of the previous project (Project 2: Circle of Life), which is a probabilistic  decision-based cat-and-mouse game. An update in this project is that rather than evaluating the best  decision for the agent based on uncertain probabilistic information (Bayesian Networks), we use  Reinforcement Learning (Utility) to give the optimum success rate for the agent.
